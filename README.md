## 📝 About

I work mainly with Java in backend systems that require high throughput and real-time processing.
My experience includes building and scaling microservices, working with message brokers like Kafka, and managing data indexing with Elasticsearch.
I have hands-on experience with Kubernetes, Helm, and containerized deployments.
